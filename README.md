The Relationship Between The GDP and Life Expectancy (A case analysis for six countries)

The relationship between GDP and life expectancy is a topic of interest in economics and public health, as it reflects the overall well-being and development level of a country.  Generally, a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy is expected since a higher GDP often translates to better access to healthcare, education, sanitation, nutrition, and other factors that contribute to improved health outcomes and longer life expectancy.

To demonstrate the relationship between of GDP and life expectancy, I analyzed data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank for six countries (Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States of America and Zimbabwe) for the period between 2000-2015.

This analysis sought to specifically answer the following questions:
•	Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
•	Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
•	What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
•	What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
•	Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
